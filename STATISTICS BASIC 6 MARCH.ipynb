    "Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics deals with summarizing and describing data. It includes measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance. Descriptive statistics are used to provide information about a data set, such as its central tendency, variability, and shape. For example, if we want to describe the average age of a group of people, we might calculate the mean age of the group.\n",

    "Inferential statistics: Inferential statistics deals with making conclusions and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It involves using probability theory and hypothesis testing to draw inferences about a population from a sample. For example, if we want to test whether a new drug is effective, we might conduct a randomized controlled trial with a sample of patients and use inferential statistics to determine if the drug is significantly better than a placebo."

Different levels of measurement have different properties and require different types of statistical analyses.\n",

We could summarize the data using frequency counts and percentages, and determine the most common educational level among employees.\n",

    "ANSWER : Measures of central tendency and variability are used in statistics to describe the main features of a dataset, such as its typical value and its degree of spread or variability. Some common measures of central tendency and variability are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset and is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency because it takes into account all the values in the dataset, but it can be sensitive to outliers and skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order. The median is a useful measure of central tendency because it is not affected by outliers or extreme values and is therefore more robust than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the most common value in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency for nominal or categorical data and can also be used for continuous data when the dataset is bimodal or has multiple peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance is a measure of the spread or variability of a dataset and is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. Variance is useful because it provides information about the degree of variability in the dataset, but it is not directly interpretable and can be affected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation: Standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is a more easily interpretable measure of variability. It represents the average distance of the values from the mean and is often used to describe the degree of spread or variability in a dataset.\n",

    "In summary, measures of central tendency and variability are used in statistics to describe the main features of a dataset.
